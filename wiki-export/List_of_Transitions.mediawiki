|-
|[[anticipate]]
|<code>Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|An increasing comb filter.
|-
|[[anticipateIn]]
|<code>Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Same as anticipate though it allows you to specify the number of cycles until dropping to the new pattern.
|-
|[[clutch]]
|<code>Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a</code>
|Degrades the current pattern while undegrading the next.
|-
|[[clutchIn]]
|<code>Time -> Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a</code>
|-
|[[interpolate]]
|<code>Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|-
|[[interpolateIn]]
|<code>Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|-
|[[jump]]
|<code>Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Jumps directly into the given pattern, this is essentially the ''no_transition''-transition.
Variants of jump provide more useful capabilities, see jumpIn and jumpMod.
|-
|[[jumpIn]]
|<code>Int -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Takes the identifier of the ControlPattern track and an integer ''cycleCount''. It will jump '''unaligned''' into the given pattern after ''cycleCount'' cycles have completed.
|-
|[[jumpIn']]
|<code>Int -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Unlike jumpIn the variant jumpIn' will only transition at cycle boundary (e.g. when the cycle count is an integer).
|-
|[[jumpMod]]
|<code>Int -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Sharp jump transition at next cycle boundary where cycle mod n == 0.
|-
|[[histpan]]
|<code>Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Pans the last n versions of the pattern across the field.
|-
|[[wait]]
|<code>Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Just stop for a bit before playing new pattern.
|-
|[[waitT]]
|<code>(Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern) -> Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Just as wait, waitT stops for a bit and then applies the given transition to the playing pattern.
|-
|[[wash]]
|<code>(Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Time -> Time -> Time -> Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a</code>
|Washes away the current pattern after a certain delay by applying a function to it over time, then switching over to the next pattern to which another function is applied.
|-
|[[washIn]]
|<code>(Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Time -> Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a </code>
|-
|[[xfade]]
|<code>Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Applies a crossfade over 4 cycles, and fades one pattern out while fading a new pattern in.
|-
|[[xfadeIn]]
|<code>Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern</code>
|Applies a crossfade, and fades one pattern out while fading a new pattern in.
