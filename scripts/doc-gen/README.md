This script generates the MDX docs for the /docs/library section of the site
based on the Haddock documentation in the Tidal repository.

It [will eventually be autogenerated] by GitHub actions, so it's not necessary
to invoke it manually. If you do want to run it locally, first generate the
Haddocks docs page by cloning the main Tidal repository and running
`cabal haddock`. Then navigate to this directory and run the command
`yarn run <path to docs>`, passing in the path to the generated documentation
(usually something like `<tidal repo>/dist-newstyle/build/.../doc/html/tidal`)
