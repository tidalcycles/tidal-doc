Starting a list of projects connected with TidalCycles - ones that
interface with/inspired/are inspired by tidal.

(For a long list of \_all\_ the live coding environments, see the [all
things livecoding](https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding) list.)

# Ports and parsers

-   [Estuary](https://github.com/dktr0/estuary) is a platform for
    collaboration and learning through live coding, hosting a range of
    environments in a web-browser, including "minitidal", a parser for
    tidal

# Editors

-   [Extramuros](https://github.com/dktr0/extramuros), a
    language-neutral shared-buffer networked live coding system in the
    browser (precursor of Estuary)
-   [Feedforward](https://github.com/yaxu/feedforward), a strange
    terminal-based editor in development
-   [Siren](https://github.com/cannc4/Siren) - a tracker interface for
    TidalCycles and SuperCollider
-   [Troop](https://github.com/qirky/troop), a real-time collaborative
    tool that enables group live coding within the same document across
    multiple computers. Works with a range of live coding languages,
    including Tidal

## Editor plugins

-   [Emacs](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/master/tidal.el)
-   [Sublime text](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Sublime_Text)
-   [vim](https://github.com/supercollider/scvim)
-   [VS Code](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vscode-tidalcycles)

# Synths and samplers

-   [Dirt](https://github.com/tidalcycles/dirt) - the original 'classic'
    dirt, implemented in c
-   [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/) - the
    SuperCollider rewrite, recommended for general use (unless running
    in a web browser)
-   [webdirt](https://github.com/dktr0/WebDirt) - the javascript
    rewrite, part of estuary

## SuperCollider (or SuperDirt) add-ons

-   [StageMaster](https://github.com/calumgunn/StageMaster) - light
    mastering chain for use during live performance in SuperCollider

# Visual systems

-   [Didactic pattern
    visualizer](https://github.com/ivan-abreu/didacticpatternvisualizer) -
    Sound pattern visualizer programmed in Processing
-   [p5jsDirt](https://github.com/Dsm0/p5jsDirt/) - integration with
    p5.js

# Syncing / interfacing

-   [Carabiner](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/carabiner), for
    bridging with the Link protocol
-   [ESPGrid](https://github.com/dktr0/espgrid), synchronisation
    designed for live coding environments including supercollider,
    foxdot as well as tidal
-   [Node.js interface](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vliegwerk/tidal)
    for sending messages between javascript and tidal

# Tidal-inspired systems

-   [Krill](https://github.com/Mdashdotdashn/krill) - a javascript-based
    live coding environment inspired by tidal
-   [tidal.pegjs](https://github.com/gibber-cc/tidal.pegjs) - is a
    parsing expression grammar for the TidalCycles mini-notation,
    written using PEG.js. The goal of the PEG is to easily translate
    strings of Tidal-style mini notation into annotated JavaScript data
    structures for use in sequencing. Works with
    [Gibber](http://gibber.cc/) and
    [Hydra](https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/)!

# Systems that inspired Tidal

-   [Bol processor](http://bolprocessor.sourceforge.net/) - algorithmic
    music system based on compositional grammars, grown from research
    into symbolic notation of tabla rhythms
-   [Euterpea](http://www.euterpea.com/) is a cross-platform,
    domain-specific language for computer music applications embedded in
    the Haskell programming language
-   Douglas Repetto's beat rotation experiments, e.g. rotcomposer in
    [MEAPsoft](http://www.meapsoft.com/showcase.php)
