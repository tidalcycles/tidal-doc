**UPDATE:** The Atom Editor will be sunsetting on Dec. 15, 2022. See the official [Sunsetting Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/)
page for more details. Tidal will be moving to the new [Pulsar editor](https://pulsar-edit.dev/). Projected timeline to have Pulsar ready with the Tidalcycles package: end of 2022. Until then, new Tidal users are encouraged to wait for the new Pulsar editor or select one of the other editors. 

Note: Tidal users who have a working Atom editor configured with the Tidalcycles package can continue to use it. But post Atom sunsetting, the Atom package manager will stop working.

[Atom](https://atom.io) is assumed to be Tidal Cycles's default text editor for newcomers. It is an intuitive but featureful code editor that can be extended with numerous plugins. You will see quite a lot of users coding with Atom because it has been recommanded for quite a while and for good reasons. The [Tidal Cycles Package](https://atom.io/packages/tidalcycles) is one of the most complete you can currently find. Atom is a free, cross-platform and open-source software. Note that there is also a [SuperCollider package](https://atom.io/packages/supercollider) that you can use as an alternative to the official IDE. Atom also supports alternative modes of input (Vim-like) through the help of various packages.

## Installation

The easiest way to find out how to install Atom is to head to the [official website](https://atom.io). Linux and MacOS users, you are likely to find it in your package manager. The installation process is hassle-free.

### Installing the Tidal Cycles plugin

Open Atom. Click on `Preferences > Install`. Search for `tidalcycles`. Click on `install`. Wait a moment.. and that's all :smile:. Be sure to check the package options as well for more customization.

### Revert to an earlier version of the plugin

Sometimes, you will need to install and old version of the Atom Package to match with a particular Tidal version. You can do this by using the command line. To install the hypothetic `3.10.0` version of the package, run the following line:

```bash
apm install tidalcycles@3.10.0
```
