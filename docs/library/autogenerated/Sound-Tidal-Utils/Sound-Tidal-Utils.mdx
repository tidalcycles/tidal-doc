### writeError
```
writeError :: String -> IO () 
```

### mapBoth
```
mapBoth :: (a -> a) -> (a, a) -> (a, a) 
```

### mapPartTimes
```
mapPartTimes :: (a -> a) -> ((a, a), (a, a)) -> ((a, a), (a, a)) 
```

### mapFst
```
mapFst :: (a -> b) -> (a, c) -> (b, c) 
```

### mapSnd
```
mapSnd :: (a -> b) -> (c, a) -> (c, b) 
```

### delta
```
delta :: Num a => (a, a) -> a 
```

### mid
```
mid :: Fractional a => (a, a) -> a 
```

The midpoint of two values

### removeCommon
```
removeCommon :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> ([a], [a]) 
```

### readMaybe
```
readMaybe :: Read a => String -> Maybe a 
```

### (!!!)
```
(!!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a 
```

like `!!` selects `n`th element from xs, but wraps over at the end of `xs`

```haskell
>>> map ((!!!) [1,3,5]) [0,1,2,3,4,5]
[1,3,5,1,3,5]
```
### nth
```
nth :: Int -> [a] -> Maybe a 
```

Safer version of !! -

### accumulate
```
accumulate :: Num t => [t] -> [t] 
```

### enumerate
```
enumerate :: [a] -> [(Int, a)] 
```

enumerate a list of things

```haskell
>>> enumerate ["foo","bar","baz"]
[(1,"foo"), (2,"bar"), (3,"baz")]
```
### wordsBy
```
wordsBy :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [[a]] 
```

split given list of `a` by given single a, e.g.

```haskell
>>> wordsBy (== ':') "bd:3"
["bd", "3"]
```
### matchMaybe
```
matchMaybe :: Maybe a -> Maybe a -> Maybe a 
```

### fromRight
```
fromRight :: b -> Either a b -> b 
```
