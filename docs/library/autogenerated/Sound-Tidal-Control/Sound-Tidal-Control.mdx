### spin
```
spin :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

`spin` will "spin" a layer up a pattern the given number of times,
with each successive layer offset in time by an additional `1/n` of a
cycle, and panned by an additional `1/n`. The result is a pattern that
seems to spin around. This function works best on multichannel
systems.

```haskell
d1 $ slow 3 $ spin 4 $ sound "drum*3 tabla:4 [arpy:2 ~ arpy] [can:2 can:3]"
```
### _spin
```
_spin :: Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### chop
```
chop :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

`chop` granualizes every sample in place as it is played, turning a pattern of samples into a pattern of sample parts. Use an integer value to specify how many granules each sample is chopped into:

```haskell
d1 $ chop 16 $ sound "arpy arp feel*4 arpy*4"
```
Different values of `chop` can yield very different results, depending
on the samples used:

```haskell
d1 $ chop 16 $ sound (samples "arpy*8" (run 16))
d1 $ chop 32 $ sound (samples "arpy*8" (run 16))
d1 $ chop 256 $ sound "bd*4 [sn cp] [hh future]*2 [cp feel]"
```
### chopArc
```
chopArc :: Arc -> Int -> [Arc] 
```

### _chop
```
_chop :: Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### striate
```
striate :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

Striate is a kind of granulator, for example:

```haskell
d1 $ striate 3 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
```
This plays the loop the given number of times, but triggering
progressive portions of each sample. So in this case it plays the loop
three times, the first time playing the first third of each sample,
then the second time playing the second third of each sample, etc..
With the highhat samples in the above example it sounds a bit like
reverb, but it isn't really.

You can also use striate with very long samples, to cut it into short
chunks and pattern those chunks. This is where things get towards
granular synthesis. The following cuts a sample into 128 parts, plays
it over 8 cycles and manipulates those parts by reversing and rotating
the loops.

```haskell
d1 $  slow 8 $ striate 128 $ sound "bev"
```
### _striate
```
_striate :: Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### mergePlayRange
```
mergePlayRange :: (Double, Double) -> ValueMap -> ValueMap 
```

### striateBy
```
striateBy :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Double -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

The `striateBy` function is a variant of `striate` with an extra
parameter, which specifies the length of each part. The `striateBy`
function still scans across the sample over a single cycle, but if
each bit is longer, it creates a sort of stuttering effect. For
example the following will cut the bev sample into 32 parts, but each
will be 1/16th of a sample long:

```haskell
d1 $ slow 32 $ striateBy 32 (1/16) $ sound "bev"
```
Note that `striate` uses the `begin` and `end` parameters
internally. This means that if you're using `striate` (or `striateBy`)
you probably shouldn't also specify `begin` or `end`. 

### striate'
```
striate' :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Double -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

DEPRECATED, use `striateBy` instead.

### _striateBy
```
_striateBy :: Int -> Double -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### gap
```
gap :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

`gap` is similar to `chop` in that it granualizes every sample in place as it is played,
but every other grain is silent. Use an integer value to specify how many granules
each sample is chopped into:

```haskell
d1 $ gap 8 $ sound "jvbass"
d1 $ gap 16 $ sound "[jvbass drum:4]"
```
### _gap
```
_gap :: Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### weave
```
weave :: Time -> ControlPattern -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

`weave` applies a function smoothly over an array of different patterns. It uses an `OscPattern` to
apply the function at different levels to each pattern, creating a weaving effect.

```haskell
d1 $ weave 3 (shape $ sine1) [sound "bd [sn drum:2*2] bd*2 [sn drum:1]", sound "arpy*8 ~"]
```
### weaveWith
```
weaveWith :: Time -> Pattern a -> [Pattern a -> Pattern a] -> Pattern a 
```

`weaveWith` is similar in that it blends functions at the same time at different amounts over a pattern:

```haskell
d1 $ weaveWith 3 (sound "bd [sn drum:2*2] bd*2 [sn drum:1]") [density 2, (# speed "0.5"), chop 16]
```
### weave'
```
weave' :: Time -> Pattern a -> [Pattern a -> Pattern a] -> Pattern a 
```

### interlace
```
interlace :: ControlPattern -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

(A function that takes two ControlPatterns, and blends them together into
a new ControlPattern. An ControlPattern is basically a pattern of messages to
a synthesiser.)

Shifts between the two given patterns, using distortion.

Example:

```haskell
d1 $ interlace (sound  "bd sn kurt") (every 3 rev $ sound  "bd sn:2")
```
### slice
```
slice :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### _slice
```
_slice :: Int -> Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### randslice
```
randslice :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### _splice
```
_splice :: Int -> Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> Pattern (Map String Value) 
```

### splice
```
splice :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> Pattern (Map String Value) 
```

### loopAt
```
loopAt :: Pattern Time -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

`loopAt` makes a sample fit the given number of cycles. Internally, it
works by setting the `unit` parameter to "c", changing the playback
speed of the sample with the `speed` parameter, and setting setting
the `density` of the pattern to match.

```haskell
d1 $ loopAt 4 $ sound "breaks125"
d1 $ juxBy 0.6 (|* speed "2") $ slowspread (loopAt) [4,6,2,3] $ chop 12 $ sound "fm:14"
```
### hurry
```
hurry :: Pattern Rational -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### smash
```
smash :: Pattern Int -> [Pattern Time] -> ControlPattern -> Pattern ValueMap 
```

Smash is a combination of `spread` and `striate` - it cuts the samples
into the given number of bits, and then cuts between playing the loop
at different speeds according to the values in the list.

So this:

```haskell
d1 $ smash 3 [2,3,4] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
```
Is a bit like this:

```haskell
d1 $ spread (slow) [2,3,4] $ striate 3 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
```
This is quite dancehall:

```haskell
d1 $ (spread' slow "1%4 2 1 3" $ spread (striate) [2,3,4,1] $ sound
"sn:2 sid:3 cp sid:4")
  # speed "[1 2 1 1]/2"
```
### smash'
```
smash' :: Int -> [Pattern Time] -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

an altenative form to `smash` is `smash'` which will use `chop` instead of `striate`.

### echo
```
echo :: Pattern Integer -> Pattern Rational -> Pattern Double -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

Applies a type of delay to a pattern.
    It has three parameters, which could be called depth, time and feedback.

This adds a bit of echo:
    `
    d1 $ echo 4 0.2 0.5 $ sound "bd sn"
    `

The above results in 4 echos, each one 50% quieter than the last, with 1/5th of a cycle between them.

It is possible to reverse the echo:
    `
    d1 $ echo 4 (-0.2) 0.5 $ sound "bd sn"
    `

### _echo
```
_echo :: Integer -> Rational -> Double -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### echoWith
```
echoWith :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Time -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Allows to apply a function for each step and overlays the result delayed by the given time.

```haskell
   d1 $ echoWith 2 "1%3" (# vowel "{a e i o u}%2") $ sound "bd sn"
   ```
In this case there are two _overlays_ delayed by 1/3 of a cycle, where each has the `vowel` filter applied.

### _echoWith
```
_echoWith :: (Num n, Ord n) => n -> Time -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### stut
```
stut :: Pattern Integer -> Pattern Double -> Pattern Rational -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

DEPRECATED, use `echo` instead

### _stut
```
_stut :: Integer -> Double -> Rational -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

### stutWith
```
stutWith :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Time -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

DEPRECATED, use `echoWith` instead

### _stutWith
```
_stutWith :: (Num n, Ord n) => n -> Time -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### stut'
```
stut' :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Time -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

DEPRECATED, use `echoWith` instead

### sec
```
sec :: Fractional a => Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Turns a pattern of seconds into a pattern of (rational) cycle durations

### msec
```
msec :: Fractional a => Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Turns a pattern of milliseconds into a pattern of (rational)
 cycle durations, according to the current cps.

### trigger
```
trigger :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Align the start of a pattern with the time a pattern is evaluated,
 rather than the global start time. Because of this, the pattern will
 probably not be aligned to the pattern grid.

### qtrigger
```
qtrigger :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

(Alias `qt`) Quantise trigger. Aligns the start of the pattern
 with the next cycle boundary. For example, this pattern will fade in
 starting with the next cycle after the pattern is evaluated:

```haskell
d1 $ qtrigger $ s "hh(5, 8)" # amp envL
```
Note that the pattern will start playing immediately. The start of the
 pattern aligns with the next cycle boundary, but events will play before
 if the pattern has events at negative timestamps (which most loops do).
 These events can be filtered out, for example:

```haskell
d1 $ qtrigger $ filterWhen (>= 0) $ s "hh(5, 8)"
```
### qt
```
qt :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### ctrigger
```
ctrigger :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Ceiling trigger. Aligns the start of a pattern to the next cycle
 boundary, just like `qtrigger`.

### rtrigger
```
rtrigger :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Rounded trigger. Aligns the start of a pattern to the nearest cycle
 boundary, either next or previous.

### ftrigger
```
ftrigger :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Floor trigger. Aligns the start of a pattern to the previous cycle
 boundary.

### mtrigger
```
mtrigger :: Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

(Alias `mt`) Mod trigger. Aligns the start of a pattern to the
 next cycle boundary where the cycle is evenly divisible by a given
 number. `qtrigger` is equivalent to `mtrigger 1`.

### mt
```
mt :: Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### triggerWith
```
triggerWith :: (Time -> Time) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

This aligns the start of a pattern to some value relative to the
 time the pattern is evaluated. The provided function maps the evaluation
 time (on the global cycle clock) to a new time, and then `triggerWith`
 aligns the pattern's start to the time that's returned.

### splat
```
splat :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```
