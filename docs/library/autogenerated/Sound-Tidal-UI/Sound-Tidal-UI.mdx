### xorwise
```
xorwise :: Int -> Int 
```

Randomisation

### timeToIntSeed
```
timeToIntSeed :: RealFrac a => a -> Int 
```

### intSeedToRand
```
intSeedToRand :: Fractional a => Int -> a 
```

### timeToRand
```
timeToRand :: (RealFrac a, Fractional b) => a -> b 
```

### timeToRands
```
timeToRands :: (RealFrac a, Fractional b) => a -> Int -> [b] 
```

### timeToRands'
```
timeToRands' :: Fractional a => Int -> Int -> [a] 
```

### rand
```
rand :: Fractional a => Pattern a 
```

`rand` generates a continuous pattern of (pseudo-)random numbers between `0` and `1`.

```haskell
sound "bd*8" # pan rand
```
pans bass drums randomly

```haskell
sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand
```
makes the snares' randomly loud and quiet.

Numbers coming from this pattern are `seeded` by time. So if you reset
time (via `cps (-1)`, then `cps 1.1` or whatever cps you want to
restart with) the random pattern will emit the exact same _random_
numbers again.

In cases where you need two different random patterns, you can shift
one of them around to change the time from which the _random_ pattern
is read, note the difference:

```haskell
jux (# gain rand) $ sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand
```
and with the juxed version shifted backwards for 1024 cycles:

```haskell
jux (# ((1024 <~) $ gain rand)) $ sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand
```
### brand
```
brand :: Pattern Bool 
```

Boolean rand - a continuous stream of truefalse values, with a 5050 chance.

### brandBy
```
brandBy :: Pattern Double -> Pattern Bool 
```

Boolean rand with probability as input, e.g. brandBy 0.25 is 25% chance of being true.

### _brandBy
```
_brandBy :: Double -> Pattern Bool 
```

### irand
```
irand :: Num a => Pattern Int -> Pattern a 
```

Just like `rand` but for whole numbers, `irand n` generates a pattern of (pseudo-) random whole numbers between `0` to `n-1` inclusive. Notably used to pick a random
samples from a folder:

```haskell
d1 $ segment 4 $ n (irand 5) # sound "drum"
```
### _irand
```
_irand :: Num a => Int -> Pattern a 
```

### perlinWith
```
perlinWith :: Fractional a => Pattern Double -> Pattern a 
```

1D Perlin (smooth) noise, works like rand but smoothly moves between random
values each cycle. `perlinWith` takes a pattern as the RNG's "input" instead
of automatically using the cycle count.
`
d1 $ s "arpy*32" # cutoff (perlinWith (saw * 4) * 2000)
`
will generate a smooth random pattern for the cutoff frequency which will
repeat every cycle (because the saw does)
The `perlin` function uses the cycle count as input and can be used much like `rand`.

### perlin
```
perlin :: Fractional a => Pattern a 
```

### perlin2With
```
perlin2With :: Pattern Double -> Pattern Double -> Pattern Double 
```

### perlin2
```
perlin2 :: Pattern Double -> Pattern Double 
```

### choose
```
choose :: [a] -> Pattern a 
```

Randomly picks an element from the given list

```haskell
sound "superpiano(3,8)" # note (choose ["a", "e", "g", "c"])
```
plays a melody randomly choosing one of the four notes "a", "e", "g", "c".

### chooseBy
```
chooseBy :: Pattern Double -> [a] -> Pattern a 
```

### wchoose
```
wchoose :: [(a, Double)] -> Pattern a 
```

Like `choose`, but works on an a list of tuples of values and weights

```haskell
sound "superpiano(3,8)" # note (wchoose [("a",1), ("e",0.5), ("g",2), ("c",1)])
```
In the above example, the "a" and "c" notes are twice as likely to
play as the "e" note, and half as likely to play as the "g" note.

### wchooseBy
```
wchooseBy :: Pattern Double -> [(a, Double)] -> Pattern a 
```

### degradeBy
```
degradeBy :: Pattern Double -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Similar to `degrade` `degradeBy` allows you to control the percentage of events that
are removed. For example, to remove events 90% of the time:

```haskell
d1 $ slow 2 $ degradeBy 0.9 $ sound "[[[feel:5*8,feel*3] feel:3*8], feel*4]"
   # accelerate "-6"
   # speed "2"
```
### _degradeBy
```
_degradeBy :: Double -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### _degradeByUsing
```
_degradeByUsing :: Pattern Double -> Double -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### unDegradeBy
```
unDegradeBy :: Pattern Double -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### _unDegradeBy
```
_unDegradeBy :: Double -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### degradeOverBy
```
degradeOverBy :: Int -> Pattern Double -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### sometimesBy
```
sometimesBy :: Pattern Double -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Use `sometimesBy` to apply a given function "sometimes". For example, the
following code results in `density 2` being applied about 25% of the time:

```haskell
d1 $ sometimesBy 0.25 (density 2) $ sound "bd*8"
```
There are some aliases as well:

```haskell
sometimes = sometimesBy 0.5
often = sometimesBy 0.75
rarely = sometimesBy 0.25
almostNever = sometimesBy 0.1
almostAlways = sometimesBy 0.9
```
### sometimesBy'
```
sometimesBy' :: Pattern Double -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### sometimes
```
sometimes :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`sometimes` is an alias for sometimesBy 0.5.

### sometimes'
```
sometimes' :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### often
```
often :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`often` is an alias for sometimesBy 0.75.

### often'
```
often' :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### rarely
```
rarely :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`rarely` is an alias for sometimesBy 0.25.

### rarely'
```
rarely' :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### almostNever
```
almostNever :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`almostNever` is an alias for sometimesBy 0.1

### almostNever'
```
almostNever' :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### almostAlways
```
almostAlways :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`almostAlways` is an alias for sometimesBy 0.9

### almostAlways'
```
almostAlways' :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### never
```
never :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### always
```
always :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### someCyclesBy
```
someCyclesBy :: Pattern Double -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`someCyclesBy` is a cycle-by-cycle version of `sometimesBy`. It has a
`someCycles = someCyclesBy 0.5` alias 

### _someCyclesBy
```
_someCyclesBy :: Double -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### somecyclesBy
```
somecyclesBy :: Pattern Double -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### someCycles
```
someCycles :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### somecycles
```
somecycles :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### degrade
```
degrade :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`degrade` randomly removes events from a pattern 50% of the time:

```haskell
d1 $ slow 2 $ degrade $ sound "[[[feel:5*8,feel*3] feel:3*8], feel*4]"
   # accelerate "-6"
   # speed "2"
```
The shorthand syntax for `degrade` is a question mark: `?`. Using `?`
will allow you to randomly remove events from a portion of a pattern:

```haskell
d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "bd ~ sn bd ~ bd? [sn bd?] ~"
```
You can also use `?` to randomly remove events from entire sub-patterns:

```haskell
d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "[[[feel:5*8,feel*3] feel:3*8]?, feel*4]"
```
### brak
```
brak :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

(The above means that `brak` is a function from patterns of any type,
to a pattern of the same type.)

Make a pattern sound a bit like a breakbeat

Example:

```haskell
d1 $ sound (brak "bd sn kurt")
```
### iter
```
iter :: Pattern Int -> Pattern c -> Pattern c 
```

Divides a pattern into a given number of subdivisions, plays the subdivisions
in order, but increments the starting subdivision each cycle. The pattern
wraps to the first subdivision after the last subdivision is played.

Example:

```haskell
d1 $ iter 4 $ sound "bd hh sn cp"
```
This will produce the following over four cycles:

```haskell
bd hh sn cp
hh sn cp bd
sn cp bd hh
cp bd hh sn
```
There is also `iter'`, which shifts the pattern in the opposite direction.

### _iter
```
_iter :: Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### iter'
```
iter' :: Pattern Int -> Pattern c -> Pattern c 
```

`iter'` is the same as `iter`, but decrements the starting
 subdivision instead of incrementing it.

### _iter'
```
_iter' :: Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### palindrome
```
palindrome :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`palindrome p` applies `rev` to `p` every other cycle, so that
 the pattern alternates between forwards and backwards.

### seqP
```
seqP :: [(Time, Time, Pattern a)] -> Pattern a 
```

Composing patterns

The function `seqP` allows you to define when
a sound within a list starts and ends. The code below contains three
separate patterns in a `stack`, but each has different start times
(zero cycles, eight cycles, and sixteen cycles, respectively). All
patterns stop after 128 cycles:

```haskell
d1 $ seqP [
  (0, 128, sound "bd bd*2"),
  (8, 128, sound "hh*2 [sn cp] cp future*4"),
  (16, 128, sound (samples "arpy*8" (run 16)))
]
```
### fadeOut
```
fadeOut :: Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Degrades a pattern over the given time.

### fadeOutFrom
```
fadeOutFrom :: Time -> Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Alternate version to `fadeOut` where you can provide the time from which the fade starts

### fadeIn
```
fadeIn :: Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`Undegrades` a pattern over the given time.

### fadeInFrom
```
fadeInFrom :: Time -> Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Alternate version to `fadeIn` where you can provide the time from
 which the fade in starts

### spread
```
spread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b 
```

The `spread` function allows you to take a pattern transformation
which takes a parameter, such as `slow`, and provide several
parameters which are switched between. In other words it `spreads` a
function across several values.

Taking a simple high hat loop as an example:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
```
We can slow it down by different amounts, such as by a half:

```haskell
d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
```
Or by four thirds (i.e. speeding it up by a third; `4%3` means four over
three):

```haskell
d1 $ slow (4%3) $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
```
But if we use `spread`, we can make a pattern which alternates between
the two speeds:

```haskell
d1 $ spread slow [2,4%3] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
```
Note that if you pass ($) as the function to spread values over, you
can put functions as the list of values. For example:

```haskell
d1 $ spread ($) [density 2, rev, slow 2, striate 3, (# speed "0.8")]
    $ sound "[bd*2 [~ bd]] [sn future]*2 cp jvbass*4"
```
Above, the pattern will have these transforms applied to it, one at a time, per cycle:

After `(# speed "0.8")`, the transforms will repeat and start at `density 2` again.

### slowspread
```
slowspread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b 
```

### fastspread
```
fastspread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b 
```

`fastspread` works the same as `spread`, but the result is squashed into a single cycle. If you gave four values to `spread`, then the result would seem to speed up by a factor of four. Compare these two:

d1 $ spread chop [4,64,32,16] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"

d1 $ fastspread chop [4,64,32,16] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"

There is also `slowspread`, which is an alias of `spread`.

### spread'
```
spread' :: Monad m => (a -> b -> m c) -> m a -> b -> m c 
```

There's a version of this function, `spread'` (pronounced "spread prime"), which takes a *pattern* of parameters, instead of a list:

```haskell
d1 $ spread' slow "2 4%3" $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
```
This is quite a messy area of Tidal - due to a slight difference of
implementation this sounds completely different! One advantage of
using `spread'` though is that you can provide polyphonic parameters, e.g.:

```haskell
d1 $ spread' slow "[2 4%3, 3]" $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
```
### spreadChoose
```
spreadChoose :: (t -> t1 -> Pattern b) -> [t] -> t1 -> Pattern b 
```

`spreadChoose f xs p` is similar to `slowspread` but picks values from
`xs` at random, rather than cycling through them in order. It has a
shorter alias `spreadr`.

### spreadr
```
spreadr :: (t -> t1 -> Pattern b) -> [t] -> t1 -> Pattern b 
```

### ifp
```
ifp :: (Int -> Bool) -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Decide whether to apply one or another function depending on the result of a test function that is passed the current cycle as a number.

```haskell
d1 $ ifp ((== 0).(flip mod 2))
  (striate 4)
  (# coarse "24 48") $
  sound "hh hc"
```
This will apply `striate 4` for every _even_ cycle and aply `# coarse "24 48"` for every _odd_.

Detail: As you can see the test function is arbitrary and does not rely on anything tidal specific. In fact it uses only plain haskell functionality, that is: it calculates the modulo of 2 of the current cycle which is either 0 (for even cycles) or 1. It then compares this value against 0 and returns the result, which is either `True` or `False`. This is what the `ifp` signature's first part signifies `(Int -> Bool)`, a function that takes a whole number and returns either `True` or `False`.

### wedge
```
wedge :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`wedge t p p'` combines patterns `p` and `p'` by squashing the
 `p` into the portion of each cycle given by `t`, and `p'` into the
 remainer of each cycle.

### _wedge
```
_wedge :: Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### whenmod
```
whenmod :: Pattern Time -> Pattern Time -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`whenmod` has a similar form and behavior to `every`, but requires an
additional number. Applies the function to the pattern, when the
remainder of the current loop number divided by the first parameter,
is greater or equal than the second parameter.

For example the following makes every other block of four loops twice
as dense:

```haskell
d1 $ whenmod 8 4 (density 2) (sound "bd sn kurt")
```
### _whenmod
```
_whenmod :: Time -> Time -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### superimpose
```
superimpose :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

```haskell
superimpose f p = stack [p, f p]
```
`superimpose` plays a modified version of a pattern at the same time as the original pattern,
resulting in two patterns being played at the same time.

```haskell
d1 $ superimpose (density 2) $ sound "bd sn [cp ht] hh"
d1 $ superimpose ((# speed "2") . (0.125 <~)) $ sound "bd sn cp hh"
```
### trunc
```
trunc :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`trunc` truncates a pattern so that only a fraction of the pattern is played.
The following example plays only the first quarter of the pattern:

```haskell
d1 $ trunc 0.25 $ sound "bd sn*2 cp hh*4 arpy bd*2 cp bd*2"
```
### _trunc
```
_trunc :: Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### linger
```
linger :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`linger` is similar to `trunc` but the truncated part of the pattern loops until the end of the cycle.

```haskell
d1 $ linger 0.25 $ sound "bd sn*2 cp hh*4 arpy bd*2 cp bd*2"
```
If you give it a negative number, it will linger on the last part of
the pattern, instead of the start of it. E.g. to linger on the last
quarter:

```haskell
d1 $ linger (-0.25) $ sound "bd sn*2 cp hh*4 arpy bd*2 cp bd*2"
```
### _linger
```
_linger :: Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### within
```
within :: (Time, Time) -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Use `within` to apply a function to only a part of a pattern. For example, to
apply `density 2` to only the first half of a pattern:

```haskell
d1 $ within (0, 0.5) (density 2) $ sound "bd*2 sn lt mt hh hh hh hh"
```
Or, to apply `(# speed "0.5") to only the last quarter of a pattern:

```haskell
d1 $ within (0.75, 1) (# speed "0.5") $ sound "bd*2 sn lt mt hh hh hh hh"
```
### withinArc
```
withinArc :: Arc -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### within'
```
within' :: (Time, Time) -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

For many cases, `within'` will function exactly as within.
The difference between the two occurs when applying functions that change the timing of notes such as `fast` or `<~`.
within first applies the function to all notes in the cycle, then keeps the results in the specified interval, and then combines it with the old cycle (an "apply split combine" paradigm).
within' first keeps notes in the specified interval, then applies the function to these notes, and then combines it with the old cycle (a "split apply combine" paradigm).

For example, whereas using the standard version of within

```haskell
d1 $ within (0, 0.25) (fast 2) $ sound "bd hh cp sd"
```
sounds like:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "[bd hh] hh cp sd"
```
using this alternative version, within'

```haskell
d1 $ within' (0, 0.25) (fast 2) $ sound "bd hh cp sd"
```
sounds like:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "[bd bd] hh cp sd"
```
### revArc
```
revArc :: (Time, Time) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### euclid
```
euclid :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

You can use the `e` function to apply a Euclidean algorithm over a
complex pattern, although the structure of that pattern will be lost:

```haskell
d1 $ e 3 8 $ sound "bd*2 [sn cp]"
```
In the above, three sounds are picked from the pattern on the right according
to the structure given by the `e 3 8`. It ends up picking two `bd` sounds, a
`cp` and missing the `sn` entirely.

A negative first argument provides the inverse of the euclidean pattern.

These types of sequences use "Bjorklund's algorithm", which wasn't made for
music but for an application in nuclear physics, which is exciting. More
exciting still is that it is very similar in structure to the one of the first
known algorithms written in Euclid's book of elements in 300 BC. You can read
more about this in the paper
The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms
by Toussaint. Some examples from this paper are included below,
including rotation in some cases.

```

`segment n p`: `samples` the pattern `p` at a rate of `n`
 events per cycle. Useful for turning a continuous pattern into a

`randcat ps`: does a `slowcat` on the list of patterns `ps` but
 randomises the order in which they are played.

### wrandcat
```
wrandcat :: [(Pattern a, Double)] -> Pattern a 
```

### _fit
```
_fit :: Int -> [a] -> Pattern Int -> Pattern a 
```

The `fit` function takes a pattern of integer numbers, which are used to select values from the given list. What makes this a bit strange is that only a given number of values are selected each cycle. For example:

```haskell
d1 $ sound (fit 3 ["bd", "sn", "arpy", "arpy:1", "casio"] "0 [~ 1] 2 1")
```
The above fits three samples into the pattern, i.e. for the first cycle this will be `"bd"`, `"sn"` and `"arpy"`, giving the result `"bd [~ sn] arpy sn"` (note that we start counting at zero, so that `0` picks the first value). The following cycle the *next* three values in the list will be picked, i.e. `"arpy:1"`, `"casio"` and `"bd"`, giving the pattern `"arpy:1 [~ casio] bd casio"` (note that the list wraps round here).

### fit

```

### permstep
```
permstep :: RealFrac b => Int -> [a] -> Pattern b -> Pattern a 
```

### struct
```
struct :: Pattern Bool -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`struct a b`: structures pattern `b` in terms of the pattern of
 boolean values `a`. Only `True` values in the boolean pattern are
 used.

### substruct
```
substruct :: Pattern Bool -> Pattern b -> Pattern b 
```

`substruct a b`: similar to `struct`, but each event in pattern `a` gets replaced with pattern `b`, compressed to fit the timespan of the event.

### randArcs
```
randArcs :: Int -> Pattern [Arc] 
```

### randStruct
```
randStruct :: Int -> Pattern Int 
```

### substruct'
```
substruct' :: Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### stripe
```
stripe :: Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`stripe n p`: repeats pattern `p`, `n` times per cycle. So
 similar to `fast`, but with random durations. The repetitions will
 be continguous (touching, but not overlapping) and the durations
 will add up to a single cycle. `n` can be supplied as a pattern of
 integers.

### _stripe
```
_stripe :: Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### slowstripe
```
slowstripe :: Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`slowstripe n p`: The same as `stripe`, but the result is also
 `n` times slower, so that the mean average duration of the stripes
 is exactly one cycle, and every `n`th stripe starts on a cycle
 boundary (in indian classical terms, the `sam`).

### parseLMRule
```
parseLMRule :: String -> [(String, String)] 
```

### parseLMRule'
```
parseLMRule' :: String -> [(Char, String)] 
```

### lindenmayer
```
lindenmayer :: Int -> String -> String -> String 
```

returns the `n`th iteration of a Lindenmayer System with given start sequence.

for example:

```haskell
lindenmayer 1 "a:b,b:ab" "ab" -> "bab"
```
### lindenmayerI
```
lindenmayerI :: Num b => Int -> String -> String -> [b] 
```

`lindenmayerI` converts the resulting string into a a list of integers
with `fromIntegral` applied (so they can be used seamlessly where floats or
rationals are required) 

### runMarkov
```
runMarkov :: Int -> [[Double]] -> Int -> Time -> [Int] 
```

`runMarkov n tmat xi seed` generates a Markov chain (as a list) of length `n`
using the transition matrix `tmat` starting from initial state `xi`, starting
with random numbers generated from `seed`
Each entry in the chain is the index of state (starting from zero).
Each row of the matrix will be automatically normalized. For example:
`
runMarkov 8 [[2,3], [1,3]] 0 0
`
will produce a two-state chain 8 steps long, from initial state `0`, where the
transition probability from state 0->0 is 25, 0->1 is 35, 1->0 is 1/4, and
1->1 is 3/4.  

### markovPat
```
markovPat :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Int -> [[Double]] -> Pattern Int 
```

### _markovPat
```
_markovPat :: Int -> Int -> [[Double]] -> Pattern Int 
```

### mask
```
mask :: Pattern Bool -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Removes events from second pattern that don't start during an event from first.

Consider this, kind of messy rhythm without any rests.

```haskell
d1 $ sound (slowcat ["sn*8", "[cp*4 bd*4, hc*5]"]) # n (run 8)
```
If we apply a mask to it

```haskell
d1 $ s (mask ("1 1 1 ~ 1 1 ~ 1" :: Pattern Bool)
  (slowcat ["sn*8", "[cp*4 bd*4, bass*5]"] ))
  # n (run 8)
```
Due to the use of `slowcat` here, the same mask is first applied to `"sn*8"` and in the next cycle to `"[cp*4 bd*4, hc*5]".

You could achieve the same effect by adding rests within the `slowcat` patterns, but mask allows you to do this more easily. It kind of keeps the rhythmic structure and you can change the used samples independently, e.g.

```haskell
d1 $ s (mask ("1 ~ 1 ~ 1 1 ~ 1")
  (slowcat ["can*8", "[cp*4 sn*4, jvbass*16]"] ))
  # n (run 8)
```
### enclosingArc
```
enclosingArc :: [Arc] -> Arc 
```

TODO: refactor towards union

### stretch
```
stretch :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### fit'
```
fit' :: Pattern Time -> Int -> Pattern Int -> Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`fit'` is a generalization of `fit`, where the list is instead constructed by using another integer pattern to slice up a given pattern.  The first argument is the number of cycles of that latter pattern to use when slicing.  It's easier to understand this with a few examples:

```haskell
d1 $ sound (fit' 1 2 "0 1" "1 0" "bd sn")
```
So what does this do?  The first `1` just tells it to slice up a single cycle of `"bd sn"`. The `2` tells it to select two values each cycle, just like the first argument to `fit`.  The next pattern `"0 1"` is the "from" pattern which tells it how to slice, which in this case means `"0"` maps to `"bd"`, and `"1"` maps to `"sn"`.  The next pattern `"1 0"` is the "to" pattern, which tells it how to rearrange those slices.  So the final result is the pattern `"sn bd"`.

A more useful example might be something like

```haskell
d1 $ fit' 1 4 (run 4) "[0 3*2 2 1 0 3*2 2 [1*8 ~]]/2" $ chop 4 $ (sound "breaks152" # unit "c")
```
which uses `chop` to break a single sample into individual pieces, which `fit'` then puts into a list (using the `run 4` pattern) and reassembles according to the complicated integer pattern.

### chunk
```
chunk :: Pattern Int -> (Pattern b -> Pattern b) -> Pattern b -> Pattern b 
```

Treats the given pattern `p` as having `n` chunks, and applies the function `f` to one of those sections per cycle.
  Running:
   - from left to right if chunk number is positive
   - from right to left if chunk number is negative

```haskell
 d1 $ chunk 4 (fast 4) $ sound "cp sn arpy [mt lt]"
 ```
### _chunk
```
_chunk :: Integral a => a -> (Pattern b -> Pattern b) -> Pattern b -> Pattern b 
```

### chunk'
```
chunk' :: Integral a1 => Pattern a1 -> (Pattern a2 -> Pattern a2) -> Pattern a2 -> Pattern a2 
```

DEPRECATED, use `chunk` with negative numbers instead

### _chunk'
```
_chunk' :: Integral a => a -> (Pattern b -> Pattern b) -> Pattern b -> Pattern b 
```

DEPRECATED, use `_chunk` with negative numbers instead

### _inside
```
_inside :: Time -> (Pattern a1 -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a1 -> Pattern a 
```

### inside
```
inside :: Pattern Time -> (Pattern a1 -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a1 -> Pattern a 
```

### _outside

```

### seqPLoop
```
seqPLoop :: [(Time, Time, Pattern a)] -> Pattern a 
```

### toScale'
```
toScale' :: Num a => Int -> [a] -> Pattern Int -> Pattern a 
```

`toScale` lets you turn a pattern of notes within a scale (expressed as a
list) to note numbers.  For example `toScale [0, 4, 7] "0 1 2 3"` will turn
into the pattern `"0 4 7 12"`.  It assumes your scale fits within an octave;
to change this use `toScale` size`.  Example:
`toScale` 24 [0,4,7,10,14,17] (run 8)` turns into `"0 4 7 10 14 17 24 28"`

### toScale
```
toScale :: Num a => [a] -> Pattern Int -> Pattern a 
```

### swingBy
```
swingBy :: Pattern Time -> Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`swingBy x n` divides a cycle into `n` slices and delays the notes in
the second half of each slice by `x` fraction of a slice . `swing` is an alias
for `swingBy (1%3)`

### swing
```
swing :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### cycleChoose
```
cycleChoose :: [a] -> Pattern a 
```

`cycleChoose` is like `choose` but only picks a new item from the list
once each cycle 

### _rearrangeWith
```
_rearrangeWith :: Pattern Int -> Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Internal function used by shuffle and scramble 

### shuffle
```
shuffle :: Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`shuffle n p` evenly divides one cycle of the pattern `p` into `n` parts,
and returns a random permutation of the parts each cycle.  For example,
`shuffle 3 "a b c"` could return `"a b c"`, `"a c b"`, `"b a c"`, `"b c a"`,
`"c a b"`, or `"c b a"`.  But it will **never** return `"a a a"`, because that
is not a permutation of the parts.

### _shuffle
```
_shuffle :: Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### scramble
```
scramble :: Pattern Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`scramble n p` is like `shuffle` but randomly selects from the parts
of `p` instead of making permutations.
For example, `scramble 3 "a b c"` will randomly select 3 parts from
`"a"` `"b"` and `"c"`, possibly repeating a single part.

### _scramble
```
_scramble :: Int -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### randrun
```
randrun :: Int -> Pattern Int 
```

### ur
```
ur :: Time -> Pattern String -> [(String, Pattern a)] -> [(String, Pattern a -> Pattern a)] -> Pattern a 
```

### inhabit
```
inhabit :: [(String, Pattern a)] -> Pattern String -> Pattern a 
```

### spaceOut
```
spaceOut :: [Time] -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`spaceOut xs p` repeats a pattern `p` at different durations given by the list of time values in `xs` 

### flatpat
```
flatpat :: Pattern [a] -> Pattern a 
```

`flatpat` takes a Pattern of lists and pulls the list elements as
 separate Events

### layer
```
layer :: [a -> Pattern b] -> a -> Pattern b 
```

`layer` takes a Pattern of lists and pulls the list elements as
 separate Events

### arpeggiate
```
arpeggiate :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`arpeggiate` finds events that share the same timespan, and spreads
 them out during that timespan, so for example `arpeggiate "[bd,sn]"`
 gets turned into `"bd sn"`. Useful for creating arpeggios/broken chords.

### arpg
```
arpg :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Shorthand alias for arpeggiate

### arpWith
```
arpWith :: ([EventF (ArcF Time) a] -> [EventF (ArcF Time) b]) -> Pattern a -> Pattern b 
```

### arp
```
arp :: Pattern String -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### _arp
```
_arp :: String -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### rolledWith
```
rolledWith :: Ratio Integer -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`rolled` plays each note of a chord quickly in order, as opposed to simultaneously; to give a chord a harp-like effect.
This will played from the lowest note to the highest note of the chord
`
rolled $ n "cmaj4" # s "superpiano"
`

And you can use `rolledBy` or `rolledBy'` to specify the length of the roll. The value in the passed pattern
is the divisor of the cycle length. A negative value will play the arpeggio in reverse order.

```haskell
rolledBy "-0.5 0.25 -0.125" $ note "c'maj9" # s "superpiano"
```
### rolledBy
```
rolledBy :: Pattern (Ratio Integer) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### rolled
```
rolled :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### ply
```
ply :: Pattern Rational -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### _ply
```
_ply :: Rational -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### plyWith
```
plyWith :: (Ord t, Num t) => Pattern t -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### _plyWith
```
_plyWith :: (Ord t, Num t) => t -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### press
```
press :: Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Syncopates a rhythm, shifting each event halfway into its arc (aka timespan), e.g. `"a b [c d] e"` becomes the equivalent of `"[~ a] [~ b] [[~ c] [~ d]] [~ e]"`

### pressBy
```
pressBy :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Like `press`, but allows you to specify the amount in which each event is shifted. `pressBy 0.5` is the same as `press`, while `pressBy (1/3)` shifts each event by a third of its arc.

### _pressBy
```
_pressBy :: Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### sew
```
sew :: Pattern Bool -> Pattern a -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Uses the first (binary) pattern to switch between the following
 two patterns. The resulting structure comes from the source patterns, not the
 binary pattern. See also `stitch`.

### stitch
```
stitch :: Pattern Bool -> Pattern a -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

Uses the first (binary) pattern to switch between the following
 two patterns. The resulting structure comes from the binary
 pattern, not the source patterns. See also `sew`.

### while
```
while :: Pattern Bool -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

A binary pattern is used to conditionally apply a function to a
 source pattern. The function is applied when a `True` value is
 active, and the pattern is let through unchanged when a `False`
 value is active. No events are let through where no binary values
 are active.

### stutter
```
stutter :: Integral i => i -> Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

### jux
```
jux :: (Pattern ValueMap -> Pattern ValueMap) -> Pattern ValueMap -> Pattern ValueMap 
```

The `jux` function creates strange stereo effects, by applying a
function to a pattern, but only in the right-hand channel. For
example, the following reverses the pattern on the righthand side:

```haskell
d1 $ slow 32 $ jux (rev) $ striateBy 32 (1/16) $ sound "bev"
```
When passing pattern transforms to functions like jux and every,
it's possible to chain multiple transforms together with `.`, for
example this both reverses and halves the playback speed of the
pattern in the righthand channel:

```haskell
d1 $ slow 32 $ jux ((# speed "0.5") . rev) $ striateBy 32 (1/16) $ sound "bev"
```
### juxcut
```
juxcut :: (Pattern ValueMap -> Pattern ValueMap) -> Pattern ValueMap -> Pattern ValueMap 
```

### juxcut'
```
juxcut' :: [t -> Pattern ValueMap] -> t -> Pattern ValueMap 
```

### jux'
```
jux' :: [t -> Pattern ValueMap] -> t -> Pattern ValueMap 
```

In addition to `jux`, `jux'` allows using a list of pattern transform. resulting patterns from each transformation will be spread via pan from left to right.

For example:

```haskell
d1 $ jux' [iter 4, chop 16, id, rev, palindrome] $ sound "bd sn"
```
will put `iter 4` of the pattern to the far left and `palindrome` to the far right. In the center the original pattern will play and mid left mid right the chopped and the reversed version will appear.

One could also write:

```haskell
d1 $ stack [
    iter 4 $ sound "bd sn" # pan "0",
    chop 16 $ sound "bd sn" # pan "0.25",
    sound "bd sn" # pan "0.5",
    rev $ sound "bd sn" # pan "0.75",
    palindrome $ sound "bd sn" # pan "1",
    ]
```
### jux4
```
jux4 :: (Pattern ValueMap -> Pattern ValueMap) -> Pattern ValueMap -> Pattern ValueMap 
```

Multichannel variant of `jux`, _not sure what it does_

### juxBy
```
juxBy :: Pattern Double -> (Pattern ValueMap -> Pattern ValueMap) -> Pattern ValueMap -> Pattern ValueMap 
```

With `jux`, the original and effected versions of the pattern are
panned hard left and right (i.e., panned at 0 and 1). This can be a
bit much, especially when listening on headphones. The variant `juxBy`
has an additional parameter, which brings the channel closer to the
centre. For example:

```haskell
d1 $ juxBy 0.5 (density 2) $ sound "bd sn:1"
```
In the above, the two versions of the pattern would be panned at 0.25
and 0.75, rather than 0 and 1.

```

### stackwith
```
stackwith :: Unionable a => Pattern a -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a 
```

### range
```
range :: Num a => Pattern a -> Pattern a -> Pattern a -> Pattern a 
```

`range` will take a pattern which goes from 0 to 1 (like `sine`), and range it to a different range - between the first and second arguments. In the below example, `range 1 1.5` shifts the range of `sine1` from 0 - 1 to 1 - 1.5.

```haskell
d1 $ jux (iter 4) $ sound "arpy arpy:2*2"
  |+ speed (slow 4 $ range 1 1.5 sine1)
```
### _range
```
_range :: (Functor f, Num b) => b -> b -> f b -> f b 
```

### rangex
```
rangex :: (Functor f, Floating b) => b -> b -> f b -> f b 
```

`rangex` is an exponential version of `range`, good for using with
frequencies.  Do *not* use negative numbers or zero as arguments!

   of `threads` per cycle and two patterns, and this function will weave them
   together using a plain (aka `tabby`) weave, with a simple over/under structure

```

### contrast
```
contrast :: (ControlPattern -> ControlPattern) -> (ControlPattern -> ControlPattern) -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern 
```

`contrast p f f' p'` splits controlpattern `p'` in two, applying
 the function `f` to one and `f'` to the other. This depends on
 whether events in it contains values matching with those in `p`.
 For example in `contrast (# crush 3) (# vowel "a") (n "1") $ n "0 1" # s "bd sn" # speed 3`,
 the first event will have the vowel effect applied and the second
 will have the crush applied.

 (aka inter-onset intervals).  For example `necklace 12 [4,2]` is
 the same as "t f f f t f t f f f t f". That is, 12 steps per cycle,
 with true values alternating between every 4 and every 2 steps.
