### transition
```
transition :: Stream -> Bool -> (Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern) -> ID -> ControlPattern -> IO () 
```

### mortalOverlay
```
mortalOverlay :: Time -> Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a 
```

### wash
```
wash :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Time -> Time -> Time -> Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a 
```

Washes away the current pattern after a certain delay by applying a
    function to it over time, then switching over to the next pattern to
    which another function is applied.

### washIn
```
washIn :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Time -> Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a 
```

### xfadeIn
```
xfadeIn :: Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

### histpan
```
histpan :: Int -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

Pans the last n versions of the pattern across the field

### wait
```
wait :: Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

Just stop for a bit before playing new pattern

### waitT
```
waitT :: (Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern) -> Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

Just as `wait`, `waitT` stops for a bit and then applies the given transition to the playing pattern

```haskell
d1 $ sound "bd"

t1 (waitT (xfadeIn 8) 4) $ sound "hh*8"
```
### jump
```
jump :: Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

Jumps directly into the given pattern, this is essentially the _no transition_-transition.

Variants of `jump` provide more useful capabilities, see `jumpIn` and `jumpMod`

### jumpIn
```
jumpIn :: Int -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

Sharp `jump` transition after the specified number of cycles have passed.

```haskell
t1 (jumpIn 2) $ sound "kick(3,8)"
```
### jumpIn'
```
jumpIn' :: Int -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

Unlike `jumpIn` the variant `jumpIn'` will only transition at cycle boundary (e.g. when the cycle count is an integer).

### jumpMod
```
jumpMod :: Int -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

Sharp `jump` transition at next cycle boundary where cycle mod n == 0

### jumpMod'
```
jumpMod' :: Int -> Int -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

Sharp `jump` transition at next cycle boundary where cycle mod n == p

### mortal
```
mortal :: Time -> Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

Degrade the new pattern over time until it ends in silence

### interpolate
```
interpolate :: Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

### interpolateIn
```
interpolateIn :: Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

### clutch
```
clutch :: Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a 
```

Degrades the current pattern while undegrading the next.

This is like `xfade` but not by gain of samples but by randomly removing events from the current pattern and slowly adding back in missing events from the next one.

```haskell
d1 $ sound "bd(3,8)"

t1 clutch $ sound "[hh*4, odx(3,8)]"
```
`clutch` takes two cycles for the transition, essentially this is `clutchIn 2`.

### clutchIn
```
clutchIn :: Time -> Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a 
```

Also degrades the current pattern and undegrades the next.
To change the number of cycles the transition takes, you can use `clutchIn` like so:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "bd(5,8)"

t1 (clutchIn 8) $ sound "[hh*4, odx(3,8)]"
```
will take 8 cycles for the transition.

### anticipateIn
```
anticipateIn :: Time -> Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

same as `anticipate` though it allows you to specify the number of cycles until dropping to the new pattern, e.g.:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "jvbass(3,8)"

t1 (anticipateIn 4) $ sound "jvbass(5,8)"
```
### anticipate
```
anticipate :: Time -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern 
```

`anticipate` is an increasing comb filter.

Build up some tension, culminating in a _drop_ to the new pattern after 8 cycles.
