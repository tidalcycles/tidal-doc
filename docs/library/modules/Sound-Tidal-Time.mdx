### type
```
type Time = Rational 
```

Time is rational

### data
```
data ArcF a 
```

An arc of time, with a start time (or onset) and a stop time (or offset)

### type
```
type Arc = ArcF Time 
```

### sam
```
sam :: Time -> Time 
```

The `sam` (start of cycle) for the given time value.
 Cycles have duration 1, so every integer Time value divides two cycles.

### toTime
```
toTime :: Real a => a -> Rational 
```

Turns a number into a (rational) time value. An alias for `toRational`.

### fromTime
```
fromTime :: Fractional a => Time -> a 
```

Turns a (rational) time value into another number. An alias for `fromRational`.

### nextSam
```
nextSam :: Time -> Time 
```

The end point of the current cycle (and starting point of the next cycle)

### cyclePos
```
cyclePos :: Time -> Time 
```

The position of a time value relative to the start of its cycle.

### hull
```
hull :: Arc -> Arc -> Arc 
```

convex hull union

### subArc
```
subArc :: Arc -> Arc -> Maybe Arc 
```

`subArc i j` is the timespan that is the intersection of `i` and `j`.
 intersection
 The definition is a bit fiddly as results might be zero-width, but
 not at the end of an non-zero-width arc - e.g. (0,1) and (1,2) do
 not intersect, but (1,1) (1,1) does.

### subMaybeArc
```
subMaybeArc :: Maybe Arc -> Maybe Arc -> Maybe (Maybe Arc) 
```

### sect
```
sect :: Arc -> Arc -> Arc 
```

Simple intersection of two arcs

### timeToCycleArc
```
timeToCycleArc :: Time -> Arc 
```

The Arc returned is the cycle that the Time falls within.

Edge case: If the Time is an integer,
 the Arc claiming it is the one starting at that Time,
 not the previous one ending at that Time.

### cycleArc
```
cycleArc :: Arc -> Arc 
```

Shifts an Arc to one of equal duration that starts within cycle zero.
 (Note that the output Arc probably does not start *at* Time 0 --
 that only happens when the input Arc starts at an integral Time.)

### cyclesInArc
```
cyclesInArc :: Integral a => Arc -> [a] 
```

Returns the numbers of the cycles that the input `Arc` overlaps
 (excluding the input `Arc`'s endpoint, unless it has duration 0 --
 see "Edge cases" below).
 (The "cycle number" of an `Arc` is equal to its start value.
 Thus, for instance, `cyclesInArc (Arc 0 1.5) == [0,1]`.)

Edge cases:
 >  cyclesInArc $ Arc 0 1.0001 == [0,1]
 >  cyclesInArc $ Arc 0 1      == [0] -- the endpoint is excluded
 >  cyclesInArc $ Arc 1 1      == [1] -- unless the Arc has duration 0

PITFALL: Don't be fooled by the name. The output cycles
 are not necessarily completely contained in the input `Arc`,
 but they definitely overlap it,
 and they include every cycle that overlaps it.

### cycleArcsInArc
```
cycleArcsInArc :: Arc -> [Arc] 
```

This provides exactly the same information as `cyclesInArc`,
 except that this represents its output as `Arc`s,
 whereas `cyclesInArc` represents the same information as integral indices.
 (The `Arc` from 0 to 1 corresponds to the index 0,
 the one from 1 to 2 has index 1, etc.)

### arcCycles
```
arcCycles :: Arc -> [Arc] 
```

Splits the given `Arc` into a list of `Arc`s, at cycle boundaries.

### arcCyclesZW
```
arcCyclesZW :: Arc -> [Arc] 
```

Like arcCycles, but returns zero-width arcs

### mapCycle
```
mapCycle :: (Time -> Time) -> Arc -> Arc 
```

Similar to `fmap` but time is relative to the cycle (i.e. the
 sam of the start of the arc)

### isIn
```
isIn :: Arc -> Time -> Bool 
```

`isIn a t` is `True` if `t` is inside
 the arc represented by `a`.
