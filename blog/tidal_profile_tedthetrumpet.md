## Livecoding

**What do you like about livecoding in Tidal?**

- I have no background in computer science, but I find the syntax suprisingly intuitive. Also, by comparison with SuperCollider, you can get a lot of music going with very little typing.

**How do you approach your livecoding sessions?**

- Two main approaches, I guess. Usually it's just [quick improvisations](https://diode.zone/w/ocNZjYtoL54a1rcymwH2Gg) on the spur of the moment, often ending up with nothing more than a one minute long sketch. I'm not particularly trying to create anything specific, and I just stop when I have something that sounds interesting.
- The other approach is when I have an idea for a particular sound or gesture or structure that I want to create. This is usually less succesful: I've got a lot of [abandoned projects](https://youtu.be/zQwASJEnYEY) where I tried and failed over a period of days or weeks to achieve some aim or other.

**What functions and coding approaches do you like to use?**

- My favourite technique is one that some people frown on: making random but fixed patterns that repeat themselves. So, for instance, rather than explicitly creating a pattern in the mini notation, I usually start with something like `d1 $ n (loopFirst $ shuffle 8 $ run 8) # s "peri"`. (Which is actually one place where SuperCollider wins in conciseness, it's basically [Pshuf](http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Pshuf.html)).


## Music
**Tell us about your livecoding music. What musical genre(s) or style(s) describe it best?**

- Three main approaches: er… [gamelan](https://youtu.be/yN1STGvmRqY), [algorave](https://soundcloud.com/tedthetrumpet/twaytee), and [abstract](https://youtu.be/ID4Zh3C2Oso)? I should say 'gamelan': in other words music that may use gamelan samples and ideas from Javanese or Balinese music without *really* being gamelan music. I have no proper skills, knowledge or understanding when it comes to dance music, but it's always fun to try to improvise an algorave banger live. 'Abstract' might be when I use something like `slowstripe` to defeat any sense of pulse and start pitching samples down a couple of octaves.

**How has your music evolved since you have been livecoding?**

- I could say that livecoding saved my musical creativity after I finished my [PhD](https://archive.org/details/TheOtherOtherHand)! I got kind of burned out after spending seven years creating a conventional portfolio of 'compositions'. With code I was able to just make stuff for myself without having to score it or get other people to play it or justify it to anyone.

**What samples or instruments do you like to work with?**

- My own samples. For me, creating and using my [own](https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/testpage/tree/master/samples/tptm) [sets](https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/testpage/tree/master/samples/longwhistles) of sounds is kind of fundamental to the creative process. For the purposes of a quick rave-up I'll happily turn to the standard Tidal set, but for me to really feel ownership of a piece I need to use samples and synths that I have a personal stake in.

**What projects are you currently working on / planning? What's next?**

- I need to find a way to release my [actual first album](https://soundcloud.com/tedthetrumpet/thealbumteaser). I finished it several years ago, but the label who were going to release it stopped functioning, so… I don't feel like I want to release it myself but I haven't found anyone else who is interested. Yet.


## Tidal Contributions
**How do you contribute to Tidal Cycles? What have you worked on?**

- I'm a musician not a developer, so I'm not really able to 'contribute' in the sense of code! However, I have made some [gamelan sample banks](https://github.com/tedthetrumpet/testpage/tree/master/nmsamples) available, asked (hopefully useful) questions on forums, taught Tidal at [my institution](https://pure.rcs.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/j-simon-van-der-walt(449d6ab3-50fe-4a02-bc83-76e1f88b2769).html), and initiated the [Floating Gold](http://www.nagamas.co.uk/floatinggold/) project that used MiniTidal in [Estuary](https://github.com/dktr0/estuary).
