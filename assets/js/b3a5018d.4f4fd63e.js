Something as simple as this is a composition:\n\nd1 $ fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht bd*2"\n\n-- Not a super interesting one, but it composes together a pattern of\n-- densities, and a pattern of sounds, to create a new pattern that is\n-- more than the sum of its parts.\n\n-- In this lesson though we\'re going to look at ways to compose what\n-- you could call \'independent\' patterns, where one isn\'t used to\n-- manipulate the other.\n\n-- Tidal is often used in live situations, but there are some\n-- functions that help you assemble multiple patterns into something\n-- like a complete \'piece\', such as a structured four-minute track.\n\n-- Before we get to that, lets look at some extra-simple ways of\n-- composing patterns together.. as they can be surprisingly useful\n\n-- First, there\'s `overlay` that simply plays the two given patterns\n-- at the same time:\nd1 $ overlay (fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~")\n             (sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2)\n\n-- Similar to this is `stack`, which lets you overlay any number of\n-- patterns on top of each other. People tend to use this rather than\n-- `overlay`, as it\'s more flexible:\nd1 $ stack [(fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~"),\n            (sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2),\n            sound "[kick:5(5,8), snare:3(7,16,3)]"\n           ]\n\n-- The above composes a list of three patterns together. You can see that\n-- a list is given using square brackets (\'[\' and \']\'), with the patterns\n-- in the list separated by commas (\',\'). You have to remember *not* to\n-- put a comma at the end of the list, only between the elements.\n\n-- The above might not seem too useful, as you could do the same with\n-- separate patterns. This sounds exactly the same as the above:\nd1 $ fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~"\nd2 $ sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2\nd3 $ sound "[kick:5(5,8), snare:3(7,16,3)]"\n\n-- Remember though that stack combines everything into a single\n-- pattern. This is useful as you can manipulate all those patterns as\n-- one. For example:\nd1 $ chunk 4 (hurry 2) $\n  stack [(fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~"),\n         (sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2),\n         sound "[kick:5(5,8), snare:3(7,16,3)]"\n        ]\n\n-- Or adding a parameter that applies to the whole stack:\nd1 $ stack [(fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~"),\n            (sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2),\n            sound "[kick:5(5,8), snare:3(7,16,3)]"\n           ] # squiz "<0 2>"\n\n-- So `overlay` and `stack` stack things up, so that they happen at\n-- the same time. Howabout sticking things together over time, so they\n-- happen one after another?\n\n-- Like overlay and stack, there is one function, \'append\' for\n-- composing two patterns together, and another, \'cat\' for composing a\n-- list of patterns together.\n\n-- For two patterns:\nd1 $ append (fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~")\n            (sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2)\n\n-- For a list of patterns:\nd1 $ cat [fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~",\n          sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2,\n          sound "[kick:5(5,8), snare:3(7,16,3)]"\n         ]\n\n-- Again, you\'ll see `cat` used more often than `append`.\n\n-- `append` and `cat` maintain the original \'density\' of the patterns,\n-- taking one cycle per cycle.\n\n-- There are variants `fastappend` and `fastcat`, that take a cycle\n-- from each of the patterns, and squash them all into a single cycle:\n\n-- For two patterns:\nd1 $ fastappend (fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~")\n  (sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2)\n\n-- For a list of patterns:\nd1 $ fastcat [fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~",\n              sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2,\n              sound "[kick:5(5,8), snare:3(7,16,3)]"\n             ]\n\n-- That\'s fine, but what if you don\'t want to loop between patterns a\n-- cycle at a time, but have something between a `stack` and a `cat`,\n-- where you can have the patterns overlap? `seqPLoop` is one answer.\n\n-- With `seqPLoop`, you say when each pattern starts and stops.\n-- Lets first emulate the `cat` from earlier, by having each\n-- pattern last one cycle.\nd1 $ seqPLoop [(0, 1, fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~"),\n               (1, 2, sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2),\n               (2, 3, sound "[kick:5(5,8), snare:3(7,16,3)]")\n              ]\n\n-- Now let\'s adjust the starts and stops, so the first two overlap by\n-- a pattern, then there\'s a gap of a cycle before the last one plays:\nd1 $ seqPLoop [(0, 2, fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~"),\n               (1, 3, sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2),\n               (5, 6, sound "[kick:5(5,8), snare:3(7,16,3)]")\n              ]\n\n-- If you want to use the same pattern more than once, you can give it a name\n--, like this:\nlet florence = fast "1 2 3 4" $ sound "lt mt ht ~"\nin\nd1 $ seqPLoop [(0, 2, florence),\n               (1, 3, sound "clap:4(3,8)" # speed 2),\n               (3, 4, sound "[kick:5(5,8), snare:3(7,16,3)]"),\n               (3, 5, florence # coarse 5)\n              ]\n\n-- If you don\'t want the pattern sequence to loop, then use\n-- seqP.

That\'s because the \'f\' only switches to\n-- the second pattern for the second half of the cycle, and no new\n-- \'clap\'s happen then.\n\n-- If we have four claps spread over the cycle, we hear the second two\n-- of them:\nd1 $ sew "t f" (sound "kick") (sound "clap:4*4")\n\n-- Sew can be really nice for blending together two more complicated\n-- patterns.
